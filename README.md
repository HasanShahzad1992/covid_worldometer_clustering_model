# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Clustering

This project involves scraping data from the Worldometer website to gather information on COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and deaths in different countries around the world. The data is then processed, analyzed, and clustered using the KMeans algorithm. Additionally, a RandomForest Classifier model is built to predict the cluster for new data.

## Overview

With the global spread of COVID-19, understanding the distribution of cases across different countries is crucial for effective response and decision-making. This project aims to analyze and cluster COVID-19 data from various countries to identify patterns and trends.

## Key Features

- **Data Scraping:** Utilizes Selenium for web scraping to gather COVID-19 data from the Worldometer website.

- **Data Processing:** Cleans and preprocesses the collected data, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

- **Feature Engineering:** Vectorizes text-based data to prepare it for clustering using the KMeans algorithm.

- **Clustering:** Applies the KMeans algorithm to cluster countries based on COVID-19 data, identifying similar patterns and trends.

- **Model Training:** Constructs a RandomForest Classifier model to predict the cluster for new data based on the features.
